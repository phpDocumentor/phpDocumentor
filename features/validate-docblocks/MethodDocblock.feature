Feature: Validate whether a Method's DocBlock is valid
  In order to have correctly interpreted source code and apply clean coding
  As a documentation generating user
  I want to see if there are any errors specifically regarding my DocBlocks for class methods

  Scenario: Show an error when a DocBlock is missing for a method.
    Given I am in the phpDocumentor root directory
    When I run phpDocumentor against the file "tests/data/NoMethodDocBlock.php"
    Then I should get a log entry "No summary for method noDocblockMethod()"
