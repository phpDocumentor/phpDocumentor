Feature: Validate whether my DocBlocks are valid
  In order to have correctly interpreted source code and apply clean coding
  As a documentation generating user
  I want to see if there are any errors regarding any of my DocBlocks

#  FIXME
#  Scenario: Show an error when DocBlocks are missing a Short Description.
#    Given I am in the phpDocumentor root directory
#    When I run phpDocumentor against the file "tests/data/NoShortDescription.php"
#    Then I should get a log entry "No summary for function \noShortDescriptionFunction()"
#    Then I should get a log entry "No short description for NoShortDescription.php"
#    Then I should get a log entry "No summary for class \NoShortDescription"
#    Then I should get a log entry "No summary for property $_noShortDescriptionProperty"
#    Then I should get a log entry "No summary method noShortDescriptionFound()"
