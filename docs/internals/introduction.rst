Introduction
============

This part of the documentation of phpDocumentor is dedicated to the design of the application and how each moving part
interacts with eachother.

Who benefits from this?
-----------------------

This documentation will not only help contributors to find their way in the application and be more effective but can
also help plugin authors to understand how to achieve their goal in the most efficient way possible. If you are a plugin
author we can also recommend perusing through the Cookbook section of the documentation as that contains recipes that
you might be able to use and will be updated on a regular basis to contain more recipes.

Content
-------

This part of the documentation globally covers the following areas (in order of appearance):

1. Application set up and global principles
2. Fundamentals of how phpDocumentor approaches and executes the task of transforming your raw source and documentation
   in a more refined form.
3. Specifics on the various supported formats and how they are transformed
4. Information on Quality Assurance and the Build and Release process

In each of these chapters we try to cover the topic as extensively possible. Should you discover errors in this document
then we would like to encouraged you to submit an issue in our `issue tracker`_ or submit a pull request to fix the
