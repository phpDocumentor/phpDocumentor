   This is a design document for the way tags should work, not all the functionality described in this document is
   implemented yet.

Introduction
------------

A Tag is, from the perspective of phpDocumentor, a syntactical element comparable to Functions, Arguments and Classes.
As such it uses the same mechanism for creation, filtering and validation.

Theory of Operation
-------------------

#. Tags may be interpreted and separated in parts by the ReflectionDocBlock component, for example::

       The @author tag is separated into a tagName, Author, E-mail address, Role and Description by the
       'phpDocumentor\Reflection\DocBlock\Tag\AuthorTag' class.

   This is done in the ReflectionDocBlock component during the parsing of a source file. If there is no reflector for
   a specific tag then the generic ``phpDocumentor\Reflection\DocBlock\Tag`` reflector is used to separate a tag into
   a tagName and Description.

#. Each individual tag is represented by a :term:Descriptor, if there is no Descriptor available then the generic
   ``phpDocumentor\Descriptor\TagDescriptor`` class is used. The TagDescriptors are populated by an :term:Assembler
   class that is invoked by the ProjectDescriptorBuilder after the parsing process.

#. Writers capable of rendering templates, such as Twig, include a tag definition that determines where to
   include sub-templates containing tag definitions

   .. important::

      Do not create a separate template file for each tag but instead make one file per plugin; this will reduce I/O
      and save performance.

   For example; the Core plugin may have a file ``[plugin]/templates.html.twig`` that defines additional blocks for
   the Twig writer, which is added by the Service Provider of that plugin.

   For more information on how to accomplish this with a specific plugin, see the documentation for that specific
   Writer.

Variant approach: Quick and dirty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Write Descriptor
#. In ServiceProvider, link a matcher to a closure assembler that constructs your Descriptor, parses your tag and sets
   the appropriate properties of the Descriptor.
#. Tag template block
