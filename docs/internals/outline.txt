Outline
=======

This is an outline design for the internal documentation of phpDocumentor.

The story that we want to tell is about the different layers that phpDocumentor has; phpdocumentor can be seen from
an architectural position and from a program flow.

Architecturally we can have the static information such as a Component Diagram, Class Diagram and/or State diagram.

In the program flow department it might be prudent to start with Activity diagrams that go deeper and deeper into
the program flow
