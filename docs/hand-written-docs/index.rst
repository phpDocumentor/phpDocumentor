PhpDocumentor is focusing on all documentation for your projects. Api docs will give insights on the code base of
your project. But it might be hard to an overview of your project's architecture by just looking at the class api's.
Or you need a written piece of text to explain a concept of your project, write a user manual. All this extra information
is what we call ``Hand written documentation``, or `Guides`_ in short.

Guides are documents that belong to your project. and can be writter in `ReStucturedText`_ or `Markdown`_. phpDocumentor
will render these guides together with your project's class documentation. But is also able to create separate
documentation sets for your none-tech readers.
