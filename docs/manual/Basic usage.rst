Basic usage
===========

You can use the ``docblox`` command to generate your documentation
for you.

In this document is shown how DocBlox can be used to generate your
documentation. It is expected that you have installed DocBlox using
PEAR; thus whenever we ask you to run a command it would be in the
following form:

::

    $ docblox

When you have installed a version directly from Github your should
invoke the ``docblox.php`` script in the ``bin`` folder of your
DocBlox installation unless you have added a symlink as described in the chapter
:doc:`Installation`.

Under Linux / MacOSX that would be:

::

    $ [DOCBLOX_FOLDER]/bin/docblox.php

And under Windows that would be:

::

    $ [DOCBLOX_FOLDER]\bin\docblox

Introduction
------------

DocBlox takes a two-step approach to generating documentation:


1. Parse the source files and create an intermediate structure file(called
   structure.xml) containing all meta-data.
2. Transform the intermediate structure file to a form of human readable output,
   such as HTML.

These steps can be executed at once or separate, depending upon
your preference.

Generating documentation
------------------------

To generate your documentation you can use the ``run`` task:

::

    $ docblox run

When ran without parameters (as shown above) it will try to get the
location of the source code and the target folder from a
configuration file (which is discussed in the :doc:`Configuration` chapter) or
exit with an error. You can use the help option (``-h`` or ``--help``) to view
a list of all possible actions.

::

    $ docblox run -h

The simplest action would be to invoke docblox to parse the given
location (``-d`` for a directory, ``-f`` for a file) and tell it to
output your documentation to the given target (``-t``) folder using
the following command:

::

    $ docblox run -d [SOURCE_PATH] -t [TARGET_PATH]

Please be aware that DocBlox expects the target location to exist
and that it is writable. If it is not, the application will exit
and tell you so.

Tasks
-----

Usage
~~~~~

DocBlox has a task oriented CLI; the first argument represents the name of the
task to execute, or if no arguments are given but only parameters then docblox
assumes you want to run the ``project:run`` task. This last mechanism provides
backwards compatibility with phpDocumentor based configurations.

Example::

    $ docblox -d . -t output

Would result in the ``project:run`` task being executed with parameter ``-d`` and
``-t``.

Another example::

    $ docblox run -d . -t output

would have the same effect as the previous command; if no 'namespace'
(thus _project:_) is provided then the namespace ``project`` is assumed.

Last example::

   $ docblox project:run -d . -t output

would have the same effect as the previous examples and is the most explicit
form.

Listing
~~~~~~~

All tasks are described below with a link to their full description. Each task
has specific arguments. It is advised to either read the detailed sub-section
or invoke ``docblox <task> --help``; this will provide a summary of the task
and its arguments.
