=====

The phpDocumentor project has the following goal:

    *"Provide PHP Developers with all the tools and resources necessary to write
    effective and comprehensive documentation with as little effort possible."*

It tries to achieve this goal by:

* Maintaining the `PHPDoc Standard`_ for describing source code meta-information
  using DocBlocks
* Providing the application `phpDocumentor`_ to

  * Generate API Documentation
  * Create reports on errors in your DocBlocks, deprecated elements and TODOs
  * Generate graphs to help understand how your project is coupled

* Providing the application `Scrybe`_ to

  * Generate Reference Documentation
  * Generate User manuals

* Providing a comprehensive documentation regarding the PHPDoc Standard, how to
  effectively write your source documentation and how each of the applications
  work.
* Providing templates_ to change the look and feel of both phpDocumentor and
  Scrybe.
* Enabling PHP Developers to extend the functionality and/or integrate these
  tools into your own application using plugins.
