Welcome to phpDocumentor
========================

phpDocumentor is the de-facto API Documentation Generator for PHP since the
year 2000.

phpDocumentor 2 is a tool with which it is possible to generate documentation
from your PHP source code. With this documentation you can provide your
consumers with more information regarding the functionality embedded within your
source and not only what is usable to them from your user interface.

Documentation generated by phpDocumentor 2 does not aim to be a replacement for
conventional documentation but is rather supplemental, or reference,
documentation.

This documention can prove to be very useful in the following, example,
situations:

* Sets of libraries or applications providing an API, such as frameworks as
  Zend Framework or Symfony.
* Pluggable architectures, such as WordPress or PyroCMS.
* Long-running, complex projects, to help you find the right function or method
  for the job.
