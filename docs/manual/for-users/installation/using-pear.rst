PEAR provides the latest released version of phpDocumentor and is an easy
way to set up your machine.

You can prepare your PEAR installation using the following commands::

    $ pear channel-discover pear.phpdoc.org

And to install phpDocumentor you can use the following command::

    $ pear install phpdoc/phpDocumentor-beta

When the installation is finished you can invoke the ``phpdoc`` command from
any path in your system. We recommend you read the :doc:`../getting-started`
section, which will explain how to start using phpDocumentor.
