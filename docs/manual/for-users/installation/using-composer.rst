Composer's package repository Packagist provides every released version of
phpDocumentor from 2.0.0 up. Composer is an easy way to add phpDocumentor to
your project.

To install phpDocumentor you can use the following command::

    $ php composer.phar require phpdocumentor/phpdocumentor

When the installation is finished you can invoke the ``phpdoc`` command from
``vendor/bin/phpdoc``` in your project's root directory. We recommend you read
the :doc:`../getting-started` section, which will explain how to start using
phpDocumentor.
