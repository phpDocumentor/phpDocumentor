@internal
=========

The @internal tag is used to denote that associated :term:`Structural Elements`
are elements internal to this application or library. It may also be used inside
a long description to insert a piece of text that is only applicable for
the developers of this software.

Syntax
------

    @internal [description]

or inline:

    {@internal [description]}}

The inline version of this tag may, contrary to other inline tags, contain
text but also other inline tags. To increase readability and ease parsing should
the tag be terminated with a double closing brace, instead of a single one.

Description
-----------

The @internal tag can be used as counterpart of the @api tag, indicating that
the associated :term:`Structural Elements` are used purely for the internal
workings of this piece of software.

An additional use of @internal is to add internal comments or additional
description text inline to the Long Description. This may be done, for example,
to withhold certain business-critical or confusing information when generating
documentation from the source code of this piece of software.

    It is NOT RECOMMENDED to store passwords or security sensitive information
    in your :term:`DocBlock`. Not even with this tag.

Effects in phpDocumentor
------------------------

:term:`Structural Elements`, or parts of the long description when the tag is
used inline, tagged with the @internal tag will be filtered out when creating
the HTML output unless the ``--parseprivate`` command line argument is used.

The :term:`Intermediate Structure File` will still contain the internal
information. Any consumer of this file is responsible himself for filtering
the information.

Examples
--------

Mark the count function as being internal to this project:

Normal tag:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

    /**
     * @internal
     *
     * @return integer Indicates the number of items.
     */
    function count()
    {
        <...>
    }

Inline tag:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

    /**
     * Counts the number of Foo.
     *
     * {@internal Silently adds one extra Foo to compensate for lack of Foo }}
     *
     * @return integer Indicates the number of items.
     */
    function count()
    {
        <...>
    }
