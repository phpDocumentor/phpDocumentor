Responsive
==========

`Responsive` is a responsive, frameless template making use of progressive
enhancement to change the way you look at API Documentation.

Enough buzzwords? We might not be done yet!

TODO
----

* Add function contents
* Add constant contents
* Hide packages if there are no documentable elements that have that package
* Give each package/namespace a generated diagram showing local elements.
* Introduce a switch or tabs to generate documentation using the short descriptions
  instead of the actual names
* Improve search to do a site wide search
* Long class names fall of the grid; tried fixing this with elipsis but it won't
  do the job as elegantly
* Add sourcecode view
* Improve this README by giving a better introduction and describing all options
* Improve the glass graph to have a nice viewer
* Make template more friendly for extendability
